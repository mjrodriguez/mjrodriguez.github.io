I am currently a Software Engineer at [Q-CTRL](https://q-ctrl.com/). I was pursuing a Ph.D. in the [Department of Applied Mathematics](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/departments/applied-mathematics). I am a [first generation college student](https://firstgen.ucsc.edu) (woot! woot!). I grew up in Tijuana/San Diego. I enjoy mountain biking, hiking, drinking coffee, eating tacos, eating Haribo gummy bears, and most recently rock climbing.
