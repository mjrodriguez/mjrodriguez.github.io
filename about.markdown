I am currently a third year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Applied Mathematics](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/departments/applied-mathematics). I am a [first generation college student](https://firstgen.ucsc.edu) (woot! woot!). I grew up in Tijuana/San Diego. I enjoy mountain biking, hiking, drinking coffee, eating tacos, and eating Haribo gummy bears.
