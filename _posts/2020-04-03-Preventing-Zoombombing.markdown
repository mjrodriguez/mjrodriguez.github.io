In the midst of the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html), UCSC has moved to remote learning through Zoom. In this first week, there has been an unfortunate amount of cases disrupting classes that people have called "[Zoom-Bombing](https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/04/condemning-online-prejudice.html)". There have even been some cases of [sexually harassing](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/fteaom/i_am_disgusted_by_the_behavior_of_people_in_the/) students and professors. So in this post I will compile some links I have found helpful in helping prepare to avoid such situations. This will probably grow with time. It's such a shame that students do not have the maturity to behave not make the situation worse than it already is.

- My friend and fellow PhD student at UCSC, Paul Wintz, wrote a very nice blog post on [Medium](https://medium.com/@paul.wintz/fighting-zoomerbombers-and-other-zoom-tips-for-teachers-e49d55db162a) to help prevent Zoomer-Bombers. I think the most helpful tip is make sure students sign in with the verified UCSC email and muting all guests in the lecture/discussion.
- UCSC has also compiled the website "[Keep Teaching](https://keepteaching.ucsc.edu/) to help provide resources for professors, lectures, and TAs/GSIs as we move into remote teaching this quarter.
