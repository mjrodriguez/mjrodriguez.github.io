I am currently a Eugene Cota-Robles Fellow in the [Department of Applied Math](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/departments/applied-mathematics) at UC Santa Cruz. I am a fifth year Applied Math Ph.D. student focusing in discontinuous Galerkin methods, implicit time integration, and numerical linear algebra. Most recently, I have also started in applying machine learning techniques to my research.

I am working under the guidance of Professor [Dongwook Lee](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~dongwook/) and [Will Pazner](https://pazner.github.io/). I am currently working on tensor-product preconditioners for Line-based discontinuous Galerkin methods. Before UC Santa Cruz, I attended San Diego State University where I completed my M.S. in Applied Mathematics and worked under the guidance of [Peter Blomgren](http://terminus.sdsu.edu).
