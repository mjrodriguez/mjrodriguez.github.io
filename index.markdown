I am currently a Eugene Cota-Robles Fellow in the [Department of Applied Math](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/departments/applied-mathematics) at UC Santa Cruz. My interests are in discontinuous Galerkin methods, implicit time integration, and numerical linear algebra. 

I am working under the guidance of Professor [Dongwook Lee](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~dongwook/). We are currently researching for ways to integrate Gaussian Processes into our research.
