I am currently a Software Engineer at [Q-CTRL](https://q-ctrl.com/). Previously, I was a Eugene Cota-Robles Fellow in the [Department of Applied Math](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/departments/applied-mathematics) at UC Santa Cruz pursuing an Applied Math Ph.D. focusing in discontinuous Galerkin methods, implicit time integration, and numerical linear algebra.

I was working under the guidance of Professor [Dongwook Lee](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~dongwook/) and [Will Pazner](https://pazner.github.io/). My worked focused on tensor-product preconditioners for Line-based discontinuous Galerkin methods. Before UC Santa Cruz, I attended San Diego State University where I completed my M.S. in Applied Mathematics and worked under the guidance of [Peter Blomgren](http://terminus.sdsu.edu).
